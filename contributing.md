============

Please feel free to fork [this repository](https://github.com/alexpchin/ga-dictionary) and add new words and definitions to the `dictionary.yml` file found in the root of the app.

Each new entry should look like this:

```
- word: The word you are defining
  definition: The definition
  link: A link to the technology's homepage or supporting information
```

Definitions should be written in English using non-technical words where possible.

It is not critical to put the definitions in alphabetical order in the `database.yml` file but try to put them in the correct letter group.

Thanks,
Alex
